# DungeonTest

A dungeon test with 3D assets using Godot 4.0rc6

## Overview

This project is a small little test demo of working with 3D tilesets to create a dungeon in Godot 4.

The first person controller code comes from the first part of this tutorial:

I added code to allow a gamepad to be used in addition to the keyboard and mouse. I used code found here for controlling the camera with the right stick:
